            <section id="work-history-info">
                <p>I am a qualified Primary School teacher. I completed a Bachelor of Primary Education and Bachelor of Arts (majoring in psychological studies), a double degree, in 2011 with a distinction average. I have worked at a small, rural school outside Wodonga since 2012, which I am currently on family leave from. I also do some casual relief teaching at a big school in Wodonga and continue to keep up my teacher registration. </p>
                <p>Currently, I am a student at Coder Academy, undertaking the Web development bootcamp. I am super excited to learn everything in this field and make the career change to IT. I am gaining confidence using HTML and CSS to design web pages but look forward to learning about Python programming next.</p>
                <p>I have many transferrable skills, that will make a career change easier. I am a fantastic team player and know the best ways to work with other. I am super organized both at work and at home and great at managing time. </p>
