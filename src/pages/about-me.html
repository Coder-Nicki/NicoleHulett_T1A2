                    <p>Hello</p>
                    <p>My name is Nicole Anne Hulett</p>
                    <p>I am a mother to four gorgeous, young children. I currently live in Wodonga and have always lived in regional areas. I grew up in South Gippsland. </p>
                    <p>In 2019, my husband and I travelled around Australia for 12 months in a caravan with 3 of our children. It was an amazing experience. We got to experience many cultures and view spectacular scenery. </p>
                    <p>My main hobbies are dog training and reading. I have a golden retriever dog named, Oakley, and I have trained him to perform all sorts of tricks, including shutting doors and finding the tv remote. </p>
                    <p>I also like to keep fit by walking, swimming or bike riding. I follow the AFL and barrack for the mighty pies, but please donâ€™t take that against me.</p>
